# QperDiem
A daily questions android app. Using native Java, Android Room to link to SQLite backend. IDE Android Studio.


## Brief
> Setting and asking daily questions is a method popularised by Marshall Goldsmith. In essence you write down a list of questions for yourself starting with the phrase “did i do my best to…”, you refer to them throughout the day as a reminder and at the end of each day you score each one based on the effort you put into it.
I have set out to develop this app to help with this.

## Status
> The project is still a work in progress, users can add questions and contexts and link questions to contexts
